# Papers, Please

Papers, Please is an agentic workflow that helps researchers stay up-to-date with scientific literature. It prioritizes articles from your favorite journals based on your interests and saves them to your Zotero library.

## Key features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Article Screening**: Leverages Gemini to extract metadata and prioritize articles based on your research interests.
- ⏰ **Set-and-Forget Automation**: Fork the repo, configure your secrets, and let GitHub Actions automatically screen the literature every week.
- 🔧 **Modular Architecture**: Written in Nextflow and fully containerized, the workflow supports multiple data sources and can be easily extended to include new features.
- 🪨 **Robust Validation and Error Handling**: Comprehensive type-safe data validation, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, API rate limits, separate pass/fail channels, and detailed logging.

## Prerequisites

- [Nextflow 25.10](https://www.nextflow.io/)
- Docker
- Add the following secrets to Nextflow's secret store:
    - Required:
        - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, from [Google AI Studio API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys). Used to query Gemini to screen and prioritize articles.
        - `USER_EMAIL`, containing your email address. Used to fetch metadata from the NCBI and CrossRef APIs.
    - Optional, for additional capabilities:
        - `SPRINGER_META_API_KEY`, from [Springer](https://dev.springernature.com/). Used to get article metadata.
        - `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, from the [Zotero settings](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys). Used to save articles directly to your Zotero library. It requires [additional configuration](config/config.yaml).
        - `PGPASSWORD`, the password to your PostgreSQL database, if you want to use it as a backend to store articles.

## Quick start

Adjust the journals you want to monitor and your research interests. See examples [here](config/journals.tsv) and [here](config/research_interests.md), respectively. Then, simply run:

```bash
nextflow run hclimente/nf-papers-please \
    --journals_tsv <your_journals.tsv> \
    --research_interests <your_interests.md>
```

The workflow will fetch the latest articles from the specified journals, screen them based on your research interests, and output a prioritized list of articles in `results/prioritized_articles.json`. It should look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Sample Article Title 1",
    "abstract": "...",
    "journal": "Sample Journal",
    "publication_date": "2025-10-23",
    "priority_decision": "high",
    "url": "https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx"
  },
  {
    "title": "Sample Article Title 2",
    "abstract": "...",
    "journal": "Sample Journal",
    "publication_date": "2025-10-19",
    "priority_decision": "low",
    "url": "https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx"
  }
]
```

### Documentation

Use `--help` to learn more about the workflow and the configuration options:

```bash
nextflow run hclimente/nf-papers-please --help
```

## Automated weekly runs on GitHub Actions

This workflow can be set up to run automatically on a weekly basis using GitHub Actions. The workflow will check for new articles based on your specified research interests and journals, process them, and save the results to your Zotero library.

To set up the automated weekly runs, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repository.
1. Modify the first lines of `config/config.yaml` to add your configuration as follows:

    ```yaml
    research_interests: "<your_interests.md>"
    journals_tsv: "<your_journals.tsv>"

    zotero:
        user_id: "<your_user_id>"
        collection_id: "<your_collection_id>"
        library_type: "user" # or "group"
    ```

1. Add [the required secrets](#prerequisites) to your forked repository. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) for more information.
